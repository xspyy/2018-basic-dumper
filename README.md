made in late 2018.

- **not updated since July.**
- **slow, not recommended to be used upon run time.**
- **un-reliable, there's about 1000 better ways to do this. Feel free to improve anything you want.**

same idea as using IDA.
1. set the string referenced to the subroutine
2. set the *calling* number of the sub_XXXXX you need (within the .text or sub margin).
3. output -> done.

what's meant by *calling* number
